Recall that in a classification network, the final output of convolution and pooling operations, called the feature map, is fed into a fully connected network that produces a vector of class probabilities. This fully connected network is called the classification head, and it is tuned using a categorical loss function (Lc) such as categorical cross entropy.\r\n",

        "An initial method of implementation could be to build a classifier network for each pixel, where the input is a small neighborhood around each pixel. In practice, this approach is not very performant, so an improvement over this implementation might be to run the image through convolutions that will increase the feature depth, while keeping the image width and height constant. Each pixel then has a feature map that can be sent through a fully connected network that predicts the class of the pixel. However, in practice, this is also quite expensive, and it is not normally used.\r\n",

Transpose convolution (or upsampling) is the process of going in the opposite direction of a normal convolution. The input to this network is the image and the output is the segmentation map.\r\n",
